# code_refactor
Project #1

## Description
- Refactoring exisiting code using semantic elements for Horiseon.
- I learned how having a streamlined code in both HTML and CSS,  allowed for an easier understanding of what the client wanted in their webpage presentation.
- Streamlined the code in HTML and CSS to not have as much duplication across the code allowing for a faster processing time in the page load.
